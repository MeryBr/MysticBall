# 🔮 MysticBall

A magic ball that not only responds... *feels*.  

You ask something, it answers. Sometimes good, sometimes... it breaks. 🤯

## What's in it?

- React + TypeScript 
- Three.js with @react-three/fiber for the magical floating ball
- TailwindCSS 
- i18next (multilanguage)
- GLSL shaders 
- Framer Motion 

## How to get it up

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
Requires Node and PNPM. And faith in the universe.
